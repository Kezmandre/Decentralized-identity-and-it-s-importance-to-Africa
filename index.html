        Bridging The Gap of identity: Decentralized Identities for a more
        Inclusive Africa
      </h1>

      <article>
        Identity is the most fundamental and primary aspect of human experience.
        Unfortunately, according to world bank around 500 million people in
        Africa lack any form of identification. This directly affect not only
        the individuals but also the growth of the continent. The exponential
        increase in the use of internet in the last decade has placed Africa on
        the cusp of demographic boom. Our interaction has shifted from physical
        interactions to digital form of interactions. <br />
        <br />
        As our lives becomes increasingly digital, the need for a secure and
        efficient approach in identity management has become pertinent. The
        digital age requires verification of identities; signing up for new
        services, accessing essential services e.g. medical care, Education,
        financial services, participation in electoral process etc... The common
        denominator behind these types of activities is authentication, they all
        ask users repeatedly to verify their identity. This incessant
        verification of user for accessing different services on different
        platform makes us leave a trail of our digital footprint online which
        pose a great threat and vulnerabilities to user identity. The personal
        data associated with these services or platforms are susceptible to
        cyber threat, identity theft, and fraud.

        Towards this ends a new paradigm called “Decentralized Identity” put
        user back in the center of their identity, this concept of identity
        gives users autonomy and improved privacy. Users are able to manage
        their information in a multitude of ways, in different context and gets
        to control who they share their identity with, and the amount of
        information being shared without relying on a specific service provider
        for mediation. This method helps to reduce fraud and protect user
        identity while giving assurance to businesses and service providers that
        information shared by users are legitimate and accurate pertaining to
        who they claimed to be. This self-sovereign concept of identity is
        significant to Africa, a continent where traditional system of identity
        is not reliable, rendering millions of people without identity and
        access to basic essential services. Decentralized identity offers a
        solution that can empower individuals and provide them with identity
        they have control over.

      <h2>Decentralized Identity</h2>

      <article>
        Decentralized identity is a framework of digital identity that gives
        user control over their digital identity without the need of centralized
        authorities (government or corporation). This concept gives individuals
        autonomy and sovereignty over their data and how it is used online to
        authenticate their identity. Our digital identities include username,
        password, degrees, licenses, search history and more. Traditional
        identity model such as login credentials typically rely on centralized
        authorities to validate and manage user identities, decentralization aim
        to shift control back to the user by storing their identity on
        blockchain and removing the need for centralized control.
        Decentralization can be used as a tool to issue and verify our digital
        identities, fraud proof certificates, degrees, and licenses i.e.
        individual can present proof of their digital identity without revealing
        the actual data. You can proof you are above 18yrs to access a censored
        website without revealing your date of birth.

        A decentralized identity encapsulates the idea that information linked
        to the identity of a person should be under the control of the
        individual and no one else. It stores individuals’ data in a digital
        format that cannot be tampered with, duplicated, or stolen. This concept
        of identity gives individuals power on who have access to their data,
        the amount of information being shared, and they can also revoke this
        access whenever necessary which ensures privacy, reduce identity theft,
        democratises access to essential services, ensuring that everyone with
        internet access can establish and use digital identity. It also improves
        interoperability, which ensures a once only approached to data access
        where no piece of data should be entered twice as there is end-to-end
        encrypted communications between individuals interlinked servers which
        in turn ensures seamless transactions across various platform and
        services with single identity.

        In decentralized identity model, individuals are assigned unique
        identifiers called “decentralized identifiers” (DIDs), which are owned
        and managed by each individual. These identifiers are stored on
        decentralized networks e.g. blockchain to ensure security and
        immutability. Each DIDs contain relevant information which individuals
        need to prove ownership and control over their identity. This
        user-cantered approach allow selective disclosure of information,
        granting individual greater control over their identity and reducing
        reliance on centralized identities. <br />
        <br />
        Decentralized identities involve different key elements that work
        together to forge some important players in the ecosystem which ensure
        individual have self-sovereignty on their identity. These players are
        the Issuer and the Verifier. The issuer is a third-party organization
        that issues credentials proving identity to users/individuals e.g.
        (government authorities that issues National ID, university that issues
        degree and employer that offers employment), all of these data are
        stored in a wallet that allows users to control and manage their
        credentials. The verifier is a third party that need to validate your
        credentials (e.g. employer that needs a proof of your degree.). Both the
        issuer and the verifier do not hold the credentials of the users, the
        user is in total control of their identity, they control the amount of
        information that is accessible to the verifier, therefore making sure
        sovereignty belongs to the user.

      <h2>Importance of Decentralization to Africa</h2>
      <article>
        Africa as a developing continent suffers from lack of identity, which in
        turn makes it difficult to prove claim, makes it difficult to access
        essential services such as health services, education, financial
        services and more. The concept of decentralized identities can be the
        game changer to propel African towards establishment of identities,
        access to financial inclusion and bridge identity gap. African can
        benefit from decentralized identities in the follow way:
      </article>

      <p>
        <b>Economic Growth:</b> decentralized identity provides a unique way
        that put users in the control of their identity thereby allowing user to
        control the amount to information being shared which provide privacy and
        security. This enables businesses to engage with their customers across
        multiple border which in turn drive entrepreneurship for economic
        advancement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Access to Essential services:</b>the concept of decentralized
        identity helps to address the issue of marginalization in remote and
        rural areas by providing them with a means of identification which they
        can use to claim and prove identity to have access to education, health
        services and financial services.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Electoral Credibility:</b> decentralization can significantly reduce
        electoral malpractices by ensuring only those that are eligible are
        allowed to participate in elections. This help to reduce malpractices
        during elections ensuring that who the people voted for is who emerged
        as winner.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Bridging Identity gap:</b> according to world bank more than 500
        million people in sub-Saharan Africa lack identification. Decentralized
        identity can help bridge this gap providing by providing digital means
        of identification to ensures individuals have control over their
        identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Migration:</b> decentralized identity can help solves the issue of
        multiple means of identification across different countries by providing
        a single means of identification which is recognized across borders.
